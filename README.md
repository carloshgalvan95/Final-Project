## Presentation

### Increase of the cost of living in Mexico City due to gentrification process

#### Background

Gentrification is often described as the change in the socioeconomics of a neighborhood, is also defined as the replacement of low-value businesses by high-value businesses. <sup> 1 <sup> 

Recently, Mexico City goverment has signed a deal with Airbnb, the objective of this alliance is to capture 5% of the total of the digital nomads in the world to move to Mexico City. The goverment of Mexico City said that this alliance would generate an economic spill of US$1.4 billion anually to various areas of the capital, it is expected that this boost the local economy and promote the employment. <sup> 2 <sup>

In the last 17 years, the average increase in housing prices in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, that includes Mexico City, part of the State of Mexico and Hidalgo has been 235%, 64% above inflation, according to the Federal Mortgage Society (SHF). <sup> 3 <sup>

The increase of the price of living, tha includes the housing prices, can cause a gentrification process and result in the  expulsion of low-income households from the neighborhoods of greatest interest and popularity opens the door to real estate speculation.

In this context, we want to **develop machine learning models to find which areas of Mexico City are the next to experiment a gentrification process in the close future.**

For this purpose, we build a database of this sources:

1. From the goverment of Mexico City, we took the open data related to the "Información Catastral de la Ciudad de México". As the cost of living, we use the mean of the unit value of land ("Valor unitario del suelo") with the zip code and the lattitude and longitude coordinates of the areas ("colonias") of Mexico City. <sup> 4 <sup>

2. The Airbnb data we use for the database consist in the location of the apartments / houses / suites / lofts in Mexico City and their prices, the data comes from  <sup> 5 <sup>

3. As a feature of gentrification, we use the number of startbucks and their locations, the data are from the Starbucks Locations Worldwide database. <sup> 6 <sup>

Then, with the data, the analysis and the deploy of the models, we want to answer the following questions:

- Which areas of Mexico City could be gentrificated?

- How much the value of land could change?

- The presence of high value business could accelerate the process of gentrification?


## Communications Protocol

For the final project we make a chat in Slack with all the members of the team, we define this channel as the first option to communicate all our findings to the team and sharing information.

Everytime we upload files to github we have to communicate this in the Slack chat.

To having meetings, we use zoom to chat and work in this project.
