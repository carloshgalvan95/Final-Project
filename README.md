# Final-Project Deliverable 2

## Presentation

### Increase of the cost of living in Mexico City due to gentrification process

#### Outline of the project

We been working in **develop machine learning models to find which areas of Mexico City are the next to experiment a gentrification process in the close future**. For this purpose, we begin to create the database and starting the data exploration analysis with these preliminary results:

1. For the unit value of land ("Valor unitario del suelo") with the zip code and the lattitude and longitude coordinates of the areas ("colonias") of Mexico City, we clean the data and map where the value is higher by a heatmap:

2. The Airbnb data that consist of the location of the apartments / houses / suites / lofts in Mexico City and their prices, we clean the data:

3. As a measure of gentrification, we use the number of startbucks and their locations, the database is clean now:

For the presentation of the project, we start to build a presentation on Google Slides, available in:

And we think we could develop a website to present the results, for this, we made a blueprint available in:

### Communications Protocol

For the final project we made a chat group in Slack with all the members of the team, we defined this channel as the first option to communicate all our findings to the team and share information.

Everytime we upload files to github we have to communicate this in the Slack chat.

For meetings, we use zoom to chat and work on this project.
