# Final-Project

## Communications Protocol

For the final project we make a chat in Slack with all the members of the team, we define this channel as the first option to communicate all our findings to the team and sharing information.

Everytime we upload files to github we have to communicate this in the Slack chat.

To having meetings, we use zoom to chat and work in this project.
