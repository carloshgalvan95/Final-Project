### Increase in cost of living in Mexico City due to gentrification process

Recently, the government of Mexico City has signed a deal with Airbnb, the objective of this alliance is to capture 5% of the digital nomads in the world to move to Mexico City. The government of Mexico City estimates that this alliance would generate an economic spill of US$1.4 billion annually to various areas of the capital, it is expected that this will boost the local economy and promote the employment.

The increase in living costs, which includes housing prices, can cause a gentrification process and result in the expulsion of low-income households from the neighborhoods of greatest interest and popularity opens the door to real estate speculation.

In this context, we want to develop machine learning models to find which areas of Mexico City are the next to experiment a gentrification process in the close future.


#### Outline of the project

We been working in **develop machine learning models to find which areas of Mexico City are the next to experiment a gentrification process in the close future**. For this purpose, we begin to create the database and starting the data exploration analysis with these preliminary results:

1. For the unit value of land ("Valor unitario del suelo") with the zip code and the lattitude and longitude coordinates of the areas ("colonias") of Mexico City, we clean the data and map where the value is higher by a heatmap:

2. The Airbnb data that consist of the location of the apartments / houses / suites / lofts in Mexico City and their prices, we clean the data:

3. As a measure of gentrification, we use the number of starbucks and their locations, the database is clean now:

#### Results

For the results, we did a presentation of the project on Google Slides is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ap996VHbBMpeXS1RzdqjnSDFi5lZDNWeR5sFTSoFnYE/edit?usp=share_link)
